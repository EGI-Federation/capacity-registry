[EGI](https://www.egi.eu/egi-federation/) is a federation of computing and storage resource providers united by a
mission to support research and development, coordinated by the EGI Foundation. EGI uses an
[Integrated Management System](https://confluence.egi.eu/display/IMS/Integrated+Management+System+%28IMS%29+Home) (IMS)
to efficiently plan, deliver, track, monitor, and account for the [offered services](https://www.egi.eu/services), while
constantly improving the service delivery to its customers.

The EGI ISM system is based on [FitSM](https://www.fitsm.eu) and consists of a collection of Confluence pages,
Jira tickets, and miscellaneous supporting documents (e.g. agreements, reports). The processes, as well as the roles
and procedures in each process, are documented in Confluence, in dedicated sections for each process.

The ISM procedures are manually initiated and executed by EGI employees. 

[EGI ISM Tools](https://ism.tools.egi.eu) is an internal service that supports the ISM processes, by offering a
centralized management interface to perform and, where possible, to automatize the procedures in each of the
ISM processes.
